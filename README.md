# Webmoira2

An attempt to make a more modern and actually mobile friendly version of https://webmoira.mit.edu that authenticates with Webathena

However, it is also my attempt to learn React.

**TODO: choose a new, nicer name for this project**

(perhaps a Greek or Mesoamerican deity to go with the theme)
